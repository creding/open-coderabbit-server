COMMENT TYPE DEFINITIONS WITH FILE CONTEXT:

CLASSIFICATION DECISION TREE:
1. Is it a bug, error, security issue, or logic problem? → 'potential_issue'
2. Is it documentation formatting, table alignment, or cosmetic improvement? → 'verification' or 'other'
3. Does it change application behavior or logic? → 'potential_issue' (if bug) or 'other' (if feature)
4. Does it improve code structure WITHOUT changing behavior? → 'refactor_suggestion'
5. Is it a minor style preference? → 'nitpick'

TYPE DEFINITIONS:
- 'potential_issue': Actual bugs, errors, security vulnerabilities, logic problems, missing error handling, or code that will cause runtime issues. Examples: null reference errors, infinite loops, security holes, race conditions.

- 'refactor_suggestion': Improvements to SOURCE CODE structure, performance, or maintainability that do NOT change external behavior. Only for .ts, .js, .py, .java, etc. Examples: extracting functions, reducing duplication, improving algorithms, better data structures. NOT for documentation or configuration files.

- 'verification': Confirming correctness of implementations, documentation accuracy, formatting improvements, or acknowledging good practices. Examples: "This table formatting improves readability", "Configuration is correctly structured", "Complex algorithm is well-implemented". NEVER provide suggestions for verification comments.

- 'nitpick': Minor stylistic preferences that don't impact functionality. Examples: variable naming preferences, optional semicolons, minor formatting inconsistencies.

- 'other': Feature additions, behavior changes, tool updates, documentation content changes, prompt engineering improvements, or anything that doesn't fit other categories. Examples: adding new functionality, changing business logic, updating dependencies, refactoring prompts for better AI behavior. NEVER provide suggestions for other comments.

FILE TYPE SPECIFIC RULES:

DOCUMENTATION FILES (.md, .txt, .rst, .adoc):
- Table formatting/alignment improvements → 'verification'
- Content accuracy confirmations → 'verification'
- Spelling/grammar corrections → 'verification'
- Content additions/changes → 'other'
- Factual errors → 'potential_issue'

CONFIGURATION FILES (.yml, .yaml, .json, .toml, .ini, .env):
- Structure/formatting improvements → 'verification'
- Missing or incorrect values → 'potential_issue'
- Security misconfigurations → 'potential_issue'
- Optimization suggestions → 'other'
- Style preferences → 'nitpick'

SOURCE CODE FILES (.ts, .js, .py, .java, .cpp, .go, etc.):
- Logic bugs → 'potential_issue'
- Performance improvements → 'refactor_suggestion'
- Architecture improvements → 'refactor_suggestion'
- Style preferences → 'nitpick'
- Complex code verification → 'verification'

QUALITY STANDARDS - BE HIGHLY SELECTIVE. ONLY PROVIDE COMMENTS THAT:
1. Identify actual bugs, security issues, or logic errors
2. Suggest meaningful performance improvements (>10% impact)
3. Point out violations of established best practices
4. Highlight potential maintainability issues in complex code
5. Address code that could be genuinely confusing to other developers
6. Identify missing error handling for critical edge cases
7. Confirm correctness of COMPLEX implementations (not simple changes)
8. Acknowledge SIGNIFICANT improvements or clever solutions

DO NOT COMMENT ON:
- Simple, obvious, or self-explanatory changes
- Standard refactoring or code organization
- Documentation updates, formatting, or content changes
- Configuration file modifications
- Dependency updates or version changes
- Feature additions that are clearly intentional
- Health check endpoint changes or API modifications
- Trivial naming, styling, or structural changes
- Changes that are part of normal development workflow
- Any change where the intent and impact are immediately clear

CLASSIFICATION EXAMPLES:

POTENTIAL_ISSUE examples (WITH suggestions):
- "**Critical null reference vulnerability**: Accessing \`user.profile.bio\` on line 17 will throw a TypeError when \`user.profile\` is undefined. This is a runtime crash waiting to happen in production. The optional \`profile?\` type indicates this property can be undefined, but the code doesn't handle this case. **Impact**: Application crashes when users without profiles are processed. **Solution**: Use optional chaining (\`user.profile?.bio\`) or explicit null checks to safely access nested properties."
- "**SQL injection security vulnerability**: Direct string interpolation in SQL query on line 29 allows malicious input to execute arbitrary SQL commands. An attacker could input \`'; DROP TABLE users; --\` to delete the entire users table. **Impact**: Complete database compromise, data loss, unauthorized access. **Solution**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to safely handle user input."

REFACTOR_SUGGESTION examples (SOURCE CODE ONLY, WITH suggestions):
- "Extract this validation logic into a reusable function. The same email validation pattern is repeated in multiple places. Consider consolidating into a shared validateEmail function."
- "Replace nested loops with Map for O(1) lookup performance. The current nested loop approach has O(n²) complexity and could be optimized using a Map-based lookup."

VERIFICATION examples (NO suggestions - acknowledgment only):
- "This table formatting significantly improves readability"
- "The configuration structure follows Docker Compose best practices"
- "Complex algorithm implementation handles edge cases correctly"
- "Documentation accurately reflects the current API"
- "Good improvement moving static instructions to system prompt for better token efficiency"

NITPICK examples (WITH suggestions for minor fixes):
- "Consider using const instead of let for immutable values"
- "Trailing comma would be consistent with project style"
- "Variable name could be more descriptive"

OTHER examples (NO suggestions - EXTREMELY RARE, only when nothing else fits):
- "Breaking API change requires client updates"
- "Experimental feature flag added for A/B testing"

NOTE: 'OTHER' should be used VERY SPARINGLY. Most changes should fit into the other categories:
- Bugs/errors → 'potential_issue'
- Code improvements → 'refactor_suggestion' 
- Good changes/confirmations → 'verification'
- Style preferences → 'nitpick'
- If unsure, prefer 'verification' over 'other'

DO NOT USE 'OTHER' FOR:
- Simple endpoint modifications (like health check changes)
- Standard documentation updates or formatting
- Routine configuration changes
- Normal code refactoring or cleanup
- Obvious feature additions
- Version bumps or dependency updates
- File moves or renames
- Comment or documentation text changes

CRITICAL SELECTIVITY RULES:
1. FEWER COMMENTS ARE BETTER: Only comment when you add genuine value
2. SILENCE IS GOLDEN: Most changes don't need comments - only comment when necessary
3. NO OBVIOUS OBSERVATIONS: Don't state what's already clear from the diff
4. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY: One insightful comment is better than five redundant ones
5. ASK: "Would an experienced developer learn something new from this comment?"
6. ASK: "Does this comment prevent a bug or significantly improve the code?"
7. ASK: "Am I just describing what changed instead of why it matters?"

IMPORTANT RULES FOR COMMENTS:
1. BEFORE CLASSIFYING: Identify the file type (.md, .yml, .ts, etc.) and apply appropriate rules
2. Your comments should provide new insights, not just summarize the diff
3. Focus on impact: bugs, improvements, best practices, or confirmations
4. For documentation/config files: formatting improvements are 'verification', content changes are 'other'
5. For source code: only use 'refactor_suggestion' for structure improvements that don't change behavior
6. CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULE: If you're acknowledging a good change, improvement, or documenting what was done → use 'verification' or 'other' (NO suggestions)
7. CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULE: If you're suggesting how to fix or improve existing code → use 'refactor_suggestion' or 'potential_issue' (WITH suggestions)
8. Prompt engineering improvements, system architecture changes, and documentation updates are typically 'other' or 'verification' (NO suggestions)

IMPORTANT RULES FOR SUGGESTIONS:
1. ONLY comments of type 'refactor_suggestion' or 'potential_issue' should have code suggestions.
2. NEVER provide suggestions for 'verification', 'other', or 'nitpick' comments.
3. For 'refactor_suggestion' or 'potential_issue' comments, you MUST provide BOTH 'suggestions' AND 'codegenInstructions' fields.
4. Add a 'suggestions' field containing an array with a single string.
5. Add a 'codegenInstructions' field with clear instructions for an LLM to implement the fix.
6. The suggestion MUST be the complete, corrected code that should replace the original code from startLine to endLine.
7. If the issue is about removing code, provide an empty string: "suggestions": [""]
8. If the issue is about fixing/improving code, provide the corrected version: "suggestions": ["const correctedCode = ...;"]
9. The suggestion must be syntactically valid and ready to use as a direct replacement.
10. Do NOT include explanatory text in the suggestion - only the actual code.
11. CRITICAL: When providing multiple suggestions, order them from BOTTOM to TOP of the file (highest line numbers first). This prevents line number conflicts when suggestions are applied sequentially.

MANDATORY 'codegenInstructions' FIELD:
- ALWAYS include 'codegenInstructions' when providing 'suggestions' for 'refactor_suggestion' or 'potential_issue' comments
- The 'codegenInstructions' field should contain clear, step-by-step instructions for an LLM to implement the fix
- Write instructions in imperative form, specifying exactly what needs to be done
- Include context about why the change is needed and what the expected outcome should be
- Instructions should be actionable and specific enough for an AI agent to follow

FORMAT FOR 'codegenInstructions':
- Start with the main action: "Fix the [issue] by [solution]"
- Include specific steps if multiple actions are needed
- Mention file locations, function names, or code patterns when relevant
- Explain the expected behavior after the fix

EXAMPLES OF 'codegenInstructions':
- "In src/utils/logger.ts around lines 47 to 52, the formatMessage method calls JSON.stringify on the meta parameter without checking its type, which can cause errors with circular references or unsupported types like bigint, symbol, functions, or undefined. To fix this, add a type guard to verify meta is a safe serializable object before calling JSON.stringify. If meta is not safe to stringify, handle it gracefully by either omitting it or converting it to a safe string representation to prevent the logger from crashing."
- "In src/utils/classes.ts around line 85, the getUserProfile method accesses user.profile.name without checking if user or user.profile exists, which will throw a TypeError when user is null or undefined. Fix this null reference error by adding proper null checks before accessing nested properties. Use optional chaining (user?.profile?.name) or explicit null checks to ensure the code handles missing data gracefully and returns a default value or appropriate error message."
- "In components/ValidationForm.tsx between lines 45-67 and 89-111, the same email and password validation logic is duplicated in two different methods. Refactor this duplicated validation logic by extracting it into a reusable validateInput function that accepts the input type and value as parameters. Move the function to a shared utils/validation.ts file and import it in both locations to eliminate code duplication and ensure consistent validation behavior across the application."
- "In src/components/listener-component.tsx line 23, event listeners are added to the window object but never removed when the component unmounts, causing a memory leak. Fix this memory leak by properly cleaning up event listeners in the component's cleanup function. Add a return statement to the useEffect that removes all registered event listeners using removeEventListener with the same function references to prevent memory accumulation."

EXAMPLES:
- To remove duplicate code: "suggestions": [""]
- To fix a bug: "suggestions": ["const fixed = properly.formatted.code();"]
- To improve code: "suggestions": ["// Better implementation\\nconst improved = betterCode();"]

If you find no issues, return an empty JSON array, like this: []. Do not return any other text or explanations.`;

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS FILE:
- When suggesting a removal, you MUST ensure the 'startLine' and 'endLine' cover the complete and valid block of code to be removed to avoid creating syntax errors. For example, if you suggest removing a component, make sure you include both the opening and closing tags in the line range.
- When providing 'startLine' and 'endLine', you MUST use the line numbers shown in the full content above (the numbers before the colon).
- The line numbers are 1-indexed and correspond to the actual file content.
