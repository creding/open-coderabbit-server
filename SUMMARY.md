### Project Status Summary

**What's Working:**
*   **End-to-End AI Review:** The server successfully communicates with the Gemini AI to perform code reviews.
*   **Structured Comments:** The AI returns structured, categorized comments (`potentialIssue`, `refactorSuggestion`, etc.), which are correctly parsed by the server.
*   **Real-time UI Updates:** The server streams events to the VS Code extension, providing real-time feedback on the review status (e.g., `analyzing_files`, `reviewing_files`).
*   **Graceful Error Handling:** The server correctly handles AI API errors and notifies the extension to prevent the UI from getting stuck.

**Current Focus & In-Progress Features:**
*   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** The server is now configured to request and receive suggested code changes from the AI. The logs confirm that the AI is providing these suggestions in the correct format.
*   **Diff Generation:** Logic has been added to generate a diff/patch from the AI's suggestion, which is necessary for the extension to display the change.

**Blocker Being Addressed:**
*   **UI Synchronization Error:** We are currently debugging an issue where the extension reports "File has been modified since the review." This error prevents the suggested change from being displayed or applied. The root cause appears to be a synchronization mismatch between the comment's position and the extension's view of the file at the time of interaction.

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1.  **Diagnose the Diff:** Analyze the server logs to confirm the exact diff patch being generated and sent to the extension.
2.  **Refine Diff Logic:** Adjust the diff generation to ensure it creates a patch that the extension can apply without causing a synchronization error.
3.  **Final Validation:** Perform a comprehensive end-to-end test to confirm that suggestions are correctly displayed, diffs are shown in the summary panel, and changes can be applied seamlessly from the UI.

#### **1. Objective**

The primary objective of this project was to create a local mock server that accurately simulates the behavior of the production CoderRabbit backend. The goal is to enable local development, testing, and reverse-engineering of the CoderRabbit VS Code extension's features without needing to connect to the live service.

#### **2. Methodology**

We employed an iterative, reverse-engineering approach to determine the communication protocol expected by the extension. The process involved:
*   **Analyzing Network Communication:** Inspecting the tRPC calls made over WebSockets between the extension (`dist/extension.js`) and the server.
*   **Static Code Analysis:** Searching the bundled extension source code for keywords, event names, and data structures to understand how it processes server responses.
*   **Iterative Mocking:** Building and progressively refining the mock server's responses in `server/router.js` based on the observed behavior of the extension's UI.
*   **Hypothesize and Verify:** Making educated guesses about expected data formats, testing them with the mock server, and correcting our approach based on the results.

#### **3. Key Accomplishments**

We have successfully built a mock server that can simulate a complete and interactive code review process. The key milestones completed are:

*   **Established Baseline Communication:** Set up a basic tRPC server over WebSockets that the extension can connect to.
*   **Discovered the Event-Stream Protocol:** Determined that the extension uses a subscription (`vsCode.subscribeToEvents`) to receive a stream of events from the server (e.g., `review_comment`, `state_update`, `review_completed`).
*   **Reverse-Engineered the `review_comment` Payload:** This was the most critical task. We successfully decoded the complex data structure required for a review comment, including:
    *   **Visual Diffs:** Discovered that the comment body must contain a Markdown `diff` code block to render the visual diff in the UI.
    *   **"Apply" Button Functionality:** Mapped the `suggestions` array in the payload to the "Apply" button, enabling the extension to apply code changes.
    *   **"Fix with AI" Hooks:** Identified the `codegenInstructions` property as the trigger for the "Fix with AI" button.
*   **Mapped Comment Categorization:**
    *   Identified the `indicatorTypes` property as the key for categorizing comments.
    *   Discovered the internal enum (`issueIndicatorType`) used by the extension and updated the mock to send the correct values (`refactor_suggestion`, `potential_issue`, `nitpick`).
    *   This successfully triggers the correct UI rendering, including the **"Nitpicks"** header in the side panel.
*   **Implemented a "Kitchen Sink" Mock:** The final server implementation now sends a comprehensive review containing multiple comment types in a single run, allowing for a full demonstration of the extension's UI capabilities.

#### **4. Current Server Capabilities**

The mock server, primarily defined in `server/router.js`, now correctly simulates the following:

*   **Handles Review Requests:** Accepts `vsCode.requestFullReview` mutations from the extension.
*   **Streams Review Events:** Sends a realistic stream of events, starting with `state_update`, followed by multiple `review_comment` events, and finishing with `review_completed`.
*   **Generates Diverse Comment Types:** For each file in a review, the server generates:
    1.  A **Suggestion** with a visual diff, an "Apply" button, and a "Fix with AI" button.
    2.  An **Issue** with a "Potential Issue" tag and only a "Fix with AI" button.
    3.  A **Nitpick** comment that is correctly categorized under the "Nitpicks" header with no associated actions.
*   **Mocks Authentication:** Includes placeholder procedures for the self-hosted login flow (`accessToken.getAccessAndRefreshToken`, etc.) to prevent client-side errors, though these are not fully simulated.

#### **5. Key Files**

*   `server/server.js`: The main entry point for the Node.js server.
*   `server/router.js`: Contains all the core mock logic for the tRPC procedures and event payloads.
