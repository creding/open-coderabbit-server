# CodeRabbit Server Streaming Functionality Summary

## Overview
The CodeRabbit server backend implements streaming functionality for AI-powered code reviews using the AI SDK v5's `streamObject` with async generators. This allows real-time delivery of code review comments to the VSCode extension as they are generated by the AI.

## Implementation Details

### AI Service (`src/services/ai/index.ts`)
- The `UnifiedAiProvider` class implements the `AiProvider` interface
- The `streamCodeReview` method uses AI SDK v5's `streamObject` with `elementStream` to yield individual `ReviewComment` objects
- The method separates static system prompts from dynamic user prompts for token efficiency
- Retry logic with exponential backoff is implemented for handling transient failures

### Review Service (`src/services/reviewService.ts`)
- The `run` method implements the streaming approach in the review process
- Comments are processed and sent to the extension immediately as they arrive
- Graceful fallback to synchronous `performCodeReview()` is implemented if streaming fails
- Maintains backward compatibility and error resilience

### Data Flow
1. Review request is received by the router
2. ReviewService is instantiated and begins the review process
3. Streaming code review is initiated using `aiProvider.streamCodeReview(files)`
4. Each comment is yielded by the AI as it's generated
5. Comments are immediately processed and sent to the extension via WebSocket events
6. If streaming fails, the service falls back to synchronous review
7. All comments are collected for final categorization and summary generation

## Testing
- Unit tests verify the streaming functionality using mocked async generators
- Tests confirm that `streamObject` is called with the correct parameters
- Fallback behavior is tested to ensure reliability

## Benefits
- Real-time comment streaming to extension users
- Improved perceived performance (comments appear as generated)
- Graceful fallback for reliability
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling emits appropriate events on errors, rate limits, or failures
- Fallback to synchronous method if streaming fails
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

## Current Issues
- Tests show a warning about streaming fallback due to missing mock implementation in tests
- The streaming functionality works in production but needs proper test coverage

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced AI modules (promptManager, contextManager, enhancedProvider, integration) are planned but not yet implemented
- These modules would provide context-aware reviews and improved prompt management
- Additional error handling and monitoring for streaming-specific issues
